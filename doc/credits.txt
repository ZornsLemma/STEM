Talbot-Watkins, Tom Seddon, Matt Godbolt, Richard Toohey, "tricky", "hoglet",
"trixster", "Coeus" and "CMcDougall" for help and advice on several points (via
the stardot.org.uk and retrosoftware.co.uk forums) while I was writing this. My
apologies to anyone I've forgotten to mention!

vttest was extremely helpful in validating the behaviour of the emulator (and
many of the test cases included are derived from it; see LICENCE.txt for more
details).

The code to page shadow RAM in and out is based on

VT100-Hax (https://github.com/phooky/VT100-Hax) was useful for testing out some
aspects of the behaviour of the original VT100 terminal.

http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/vt102.html was useful for testing out some
aspects of the behaviour of the original VT102 terminal.

The idea of representing "N" as a lower-case "n" (inverted-"U") in the "NL"
special character bitmap (character 104/&68/0150) is based on asciimario's 3x5
pixel font: http://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/716744/3_by_5_pixel_font

The demonstration VT100 animations were taken from

The BeebAsm assembler used to write STEM has helped to make it a pleasant
experience; the scoped labels in particular are great for modularising a large
code base.
