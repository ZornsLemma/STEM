\ Top level file for a standalone test of memmove.beebasm; used to gain
\ confidence that it's correct in a range of cases, some manually chosen and
\ some randomly generated. This is assembled using "beebasm -o" to generate a
\ file containing the assembled code, rather than a disc image, and the result
\ is included in stem.beebasm.
